    "## _*Comparing Classical and Quantum Finite Automata (QFA)*_\n",
    "\n",
    "Finite Automaton has been a mathematical model for computation since its invention in the 1940s. The purpose of a Finite State Machine is to recognize patterns within an input taken from some character set and accept or reject the input based on whether the pattern defined by the machine occurs in the input. The machine requires a list of states, the initial state, and the conditions for each transition from state to state. Such classical examples are vending machines, coin-operated turnstiles, elevators, traffic lights, etc. \n",
    "\n",
    "In the classical algorithm, the sequence begins in the start state, and will only make a transition if the next character in the input string matches the label on the transition from the current to the next state. The machine will continue making transitions on each input character until no move is possible. The string will be accepted if its final state is in the accept state and will be rejected if its final state is anywhere else. \n",
    "\n",
    "As for Quantum Finite Automata (QFA), the machine works by accepting a finite-length string of letters from a finite alphabet and utilizing quantum properties such as superposition to assign the string a probability of being in either the accept or reject state. "

If the user does not input a prime number, the output will be a ValueError. First, we demonstrate a simpler version of the quantum algorithm that uses $ log(p) $ qubits to store the information.

If $ i $ divides $ p $, $ \\cos \\theta $ will be one for every qubit and the state will collapse to $ |0\\rangle $ to demonstrate an accept state with a probability of one.
